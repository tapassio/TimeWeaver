/**
 * Assignment Trail — the CDCL implication-graph substrate for LCG Phase 2.
 *
 * An ordered record of every Boolean literal assigned during search (decisions
 * and clause/Boolean propagations), partitioned by DECISION LEVEL. The trail
 * mirrors `TrailMap`'s chronological `pushLevel`/`popLevel` discipline, but
 * tracks levels + assignment order — the two things 1-UIP conflict analysis
 * needs that `ReasonTrail` (an unordered var→reason map) cannot provide.
 *
 * LEVEL DISCIPLINE: the solver pushes a level at the ROOT (level 0, holding
 * presolve/setup facts) and once per BRANCH DECISION. It does NOT push at the
 * per-node propagation-only `pushLevel` (that is a `TrailMap` checkpoint only).
 * So `currentLevel` == the number of branch decisions on the stack.
 *
 * The trail is the SOLVER's responsibility (it already owns `TrailMap` and
 * `ReasonTrail`); the clause engine stays stateless for propagation.
